/*PROBLEM 2: Kilometers	/Hour calculator function â€“ create a program that will compute for
the speed of a car in km/h (kilometers/hour) based on two variables: 1.)the distance travelled	
in miles (yes, that is miles) and 2.)the time in minutes it took the car to travel the distance.	
Assume that only the value of minutes is a whole number and distance travelled is a real number 
(can	have decimal	points).The result calculated (km /h)should be printed out as a	real number.*/
